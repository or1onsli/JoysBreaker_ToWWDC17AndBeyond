This is the playground which I made from scratch in about 24 hours as submission for the **WWDC 2017 Scholarship**.

 ## What is this playground about?
 
Joys Breaker is a game which came out casually during a brainstorming session with a tutor and a mate at the iOS Developer Academy in Naples. The original concept was about reverting the rules of the original *Breakout* game giving justice to all the destroyed bricks across the years!
 
For this particular occasion I changed something introducing myself as **The Ball!** I'm there in front of six bodyguards who don't want to let me go into the Pantheon of the App Developers!
*Help me to conquer the first WWDC of my life, let's get into the McEnery Convention Center*!

## How to play it.
 
To play this game is pretty simple. You have to click with the mouse near my figure to push me around the hall  with your 💪🏻 ***super-user-super-powers*** 💪🏻 and to help me go through security.
 
- You only have *100* seconds to help me get in before the conference starts!  ⌚️
 
The bad guys will push me against the objects at the top of the screen. Since I am stubborn every object that I hurt will break down into pieces (just like my heart if I don't get in 💔)...
 
- If we break all the objects before the conference starts I will lose my chance to get in too.   👀
